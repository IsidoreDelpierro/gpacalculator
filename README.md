GPA Calculator helps a student calculate their grade point average once they enter their information and current results.

The algorithms used to calculate the GPA are sampled from the methods used by the University of Buea (Cameroon) to calculate final results for students.

Any special considerations made for a student, which may somehow lead to a change in their final Cumulative GPA are not included in this app because those cannot be predicted.


NB: I first built this app as a class project (using PHP and MySQL), but then, for some reason I never uploaded it. When I started learning Python and Django I thought it could be a good project to use to learn. So I rebuilt it from scratch using Python. What we have in this repo is a remake of the project using Django (with SQLite3).

It's a work in progress, so feel free to make changes.
