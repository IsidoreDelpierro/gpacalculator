# gpacalculator
Helps a student calculate their grade point average once they enter their information and current results
The algorithm used to calculate the GPA is sampled from the method used by the University of Buea (Cameroon) to calculate final results for students.
Any special considerations made for a student, which may somehow lead to a change in their final Cumulative GPA are not included in this app because those cannot be predicted.
